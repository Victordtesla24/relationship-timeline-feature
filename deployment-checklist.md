## Deployment Process

### Staging Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Run automated tests against staging
- [ ] Verify monitoring is working in staging
- [ ] Perform manual smoke tests on staging

### Production Deployment
- [ ] Create deployment branch from approved staging version
- [ ] Verify CI/CD pipeline runs successfully
- [ ] Deploy to production environment
- [ ] Verify deployment status in Vercel dashboard

## Post-Deployment

### Verification
- [ ] Run post-deployment tests (`npx playwright test e2e-tests/post-deployment.test.js`)
- [ ] Verify application loads correctly at production URL
- [ ] Check for any errors in monitoring system
