## Getting Started

The Relationship Timeline app is a browser-based application that requires no login or account creation. All your data is stored locally in your browser's storage.

To get started:
1. Visit [https://relationship-timeline-feature.vercel.app](https://relationship-timeline-feature.vercel.app)
2. You'll be presented with the dashboard where you can create your first timeline

**Important**: Since data is stored in your browser's localStorage:
- Using a different browser or clearing browser data will make your timeline inaccessible
- The application works best on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Creating a Timeline

To create a new relationship timeline:

1. From the dashboard, click the "Create New Timeline" button
2. Enter the following information:
   - **Title**: Give your timeline a meaningful name (e.g., "Our Journey Together")
   - **Description**: Add a brief description of the relationship
3. Click "Create Timeline" to save

Your timeline will now appear on the dashboard, ready for you to add events.

## Adding Events

Events are the key moments in your relationship that you want to document. To add an event:

1. From your timeline view, click the "Add Event" button
2. Fill in the event details:
   - **Title**: Name your event (e.g., "First Date", "Anniversary")
   - **Date**: Select the date when the event occurred
   - **Description**: Write about what happened and why it's significant
3. Optionally, add media (photos or documents)
4. Click "Save Event" to add it to your timeline

Events will automatically be arranged in chronological order on your timeline.

## Troubleshooting

### Data Not Saving

If your data isn't saving properly:
- Check that your browser allows localStorage (not in incognito/private mode)
- Ensure you have sufficient storage space (typically 5-10MB per domain)
- Try using another modern browser if issues persist

### Media Upload Issues

If you have trouble uploading media:
- Verify the file is under the 5MB size limit
- Check that you're using a supported file format
- Try resizing or compressing large images before uploading

### Export Problems

If exports aren't working correctly:
- For large timelines with many images, try exporting smaller date ranges
- Disable any ad blockers or script blockers that might interfere
- If export hangs, refresh the page and try again with fewer images selected

### Browser Compatibility

This application works best on:
- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+ (Chromium-based)

If you experience issues, updating your browser to the latest version may help.
