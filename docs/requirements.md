# REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT

## High level Requirements
I want to build a simple and straightward relationship timeline web app for a client, where they can add events on a timelines (relationship) with their ex, upload photos, documents, events, dates, comments and more. They also want to be able to view, edit and ask questions regarding any point in time on my timeline. 

The timeline must have a polished, professional and user friendly UI layout with advanced and animated, high quality visuals without overdoing it. The client wants a simple and a straight forward app with no over complication of these requirements, so do not add, remove, delete or change any requirements in this document.

The web app will be deployed and hosted in vercel, and hence must be developed for Vercel app from the beginning. Only use one environment for both development, testing and production implementation - ***DO NOT CREATE OR USE MORE THAN ONE ENVIRONMENT***-. Use only one @.env file for storing and accessing environment variables

Only use localStorage for storing and accessing events and timeline data. No database is required - do not use MongoDB or any other database.

Do not over complicate requirements and use a Fail Fast approach, first get a working prototype ready and deployment, then add complexity, else don't. There are no security or authentication requirements. The application should work without any login or user accounts.

Before deploying to vercel, you must commit to github <https://github.com/Victordtesla24/relationship-timeline-feature.git>

The Core Features: 
  - Be able to create a timeline
  - Be able to view my relationship timeline
  - Be able to add, update and delete events within a timeline
  - Be able to update dates, delete dates in any given event within a timeline
  - Be able to update any event with photos, comments etc.
  - Be able to export the timeline in word or a pdf document with options of from and to dates or full timeline with all the details exported in exactly same layout and UI design as it can be seen on the web app

## Implementation Directives

### Critical Implementation Rules
1. **Single Environment Development**: 
   - STRICTLY use only ONE environment for development, testing, and production
   - Maintain a single `.env` file for all environment variables
   - DO NOT create separate configurations for different environments

2. **Code Quality Requirements**:
   - NO mock-ups, placeholders, or temporary implementations permitted
   - NO fallback mechanisms or workarounds permitted
   - NO error masking or warning suppression techniques

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Data Models
Utilize and extend these data models from the existing type definitions:

```typescript
// Timeline Data Model
interface Timeline {
  _id: string;              // Unique identifier
  title: string;            // Timeline title 
  description: string;      // Timeline description
  eventIds: string[];       // References to events
  createdAt: string;        // ISO date string
  updatedAt: string;        // ISO date string
}

// Event Data Model
interface Event {
  _id: string;              // Unique identifier
  title: string;            // Event title
  description: string;      // Event description
  date: string;             // ISO date string
  mediaIds: string[];       // References to media items
  commentIds?: string[];    // References to comments
  createdAt: string;        // ISO date string
  updatedAt: string;        // ISO date string
}

// Media Item Data Model
interface MediaItem {
  _id: string;              // Unique identifier
  type: 'image' | 'document'; // Media type
  data: string;             // Base64 encoded content
  filename: string;         // Original filename
  eventId: string;          // Parent event reference
  createdAt: string;        // ISO date string
}

// Comment Data Model
interface Comment {
  _id: string;              // Unique identifier
  content: string;          // Comment text
  eventId: string;          // Parent event reference
  createdAt: string;        // ISO date string
}
```

### 2. LocalStorage Implementation
```javascript
// localStorage Keys - Use existing keys if present
const STORAGE_KEYS = {
  TIMELINE: 'relationship_timeline',
  EVENTS: 'timeline_events',

## Deployment Guidelines

### Development and Production Build Process
1. **Local Development**
   - Use existing Next.js dev server: `npm run dev`
   - Test with production build: `npm run build && npm start`

2. **Pre-deployment Checks**
   - Run all tests: `npm test`
   - Build verification: `npm run build`
   - Check for console errors
   - Verify localStorage functionality

3. **Deployment Process**
   - Commit to GitHub: `git push origin main`
   - Deploy to Vercel: `vercel --prod`
   - Verify deployment functionality

### Error Resolution Protocol
For ANY error encountered during development or production:

1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Identify all possible causes
   - Check logs, code, and configurations
   - Trace errors to their source
   - Do NOT mask or suppress errors

2. **Targeted Fix Implementation**
   - Apply minimal, focused changes
   - Fix the actual cause, not symptoms
   - Follow the established error-fixing protocol
   - Verify fix effectiveness with tests

3. **Verification Process**
   - Confirm error resolution
   - Run regression tests
   - Ensure no new issues introduced
   - Document the fix and implementation

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **localStorage Limitations**
   - **Risk**: Exceeding storage limits with media content
   - **Mitigation**: Implement media compression and size limits

2. **Export Functionality**
   - **Risk**: Difficulty maintaining UI layout in exports
   - **Mitigation**: Use readily available, free libraries or github repos that can minimise custom coding the export feature

3. **Performance Issues**
   - **Risk**: Slow performance with many events/media
   - **Mitigation**: Implement pagination and lazy loading

### Project Risks
1. **Scope Management**
   - **Risk**: Feature creep beyond core requirements
   - **Mitigation**: Strict adherence to requirements document

2. **Timeline Constraints**
   - **Risk**: Underestimating development time
   - **Mitigation**: Phased implementation with clear milestones

## Summary of Requirements
A straightforward relationship timeline web application that enables users to:
- Document significant events in a relationship chronologically
- Add multimedia content (photos, documents) to each event
- Edit and manage timeline events and their dates
- Export the timeline as a document that maintains the web UI's visual design
- Utilize a professional, animated UI that remains simple and intuitive
- Operate without user authentication, using only local browser storage

## High level Solution Design
The application will be a client-side web app built with Next.js and deployed on Vercel. All data will be stored in the browser's localStorage to eliminate database dependencies. The solution emphasizes a polished UI with appropriate animations while maintaining simplicity and ease of use.
